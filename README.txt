Universal Transverse Mercator Library
======================================

MATLAB code for calculation of Easting, Northing and time zone from a target 
geographic position, and ellipsoid (direct method) and calculation of the target 
geographic position from Easting, Northing, and time zone (inverse method) using
the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. Convergence and scale factor 
are also given as outputs of the inverse routines.

Unit tests are included.

Check the "Docs" folder for more details about the UTM projection.
